# Shapeless Lab

This is my lab for learning about the features that Shapeless has to offer. It's my personal reference in the first place
but if it helps someone else, all the better. However, if one wants to learn Shapeless, your first place should really be
Dave Gurnell's excellent [The Type Astronaut's Guide to Shapeless](http://underscore.io/books/shapeless-guide/), with which
I am starting my explorations here.

My explorations are sparsely documented in `doc`. These documents represent working code that get compiled using
[Rob Norris' simple and very useful tut sbt-plugin](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut).
