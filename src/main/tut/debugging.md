# Debugging implicits

Reify allows one to inspect the ADT generated by Scalac for our Scala code, and may give us hints about type parameters being derived too generically, and implicits not being resolved.

This is what happens if all goes well
```tut
import com.github.mboogerd.csv._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

println(reify(CellEncoder[Int]))
```

However, making things go wrong with reify being helpful is more complicated than this... 
```tut:fail
// Apparently it is not as simple as this
println(reify(CellEncoder[Double]))
```
